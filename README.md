##1 The question you are setting out to answer
	
	
##2 The methodology you are using to answer the question
	 

####2.1 Any tools you are using 
		1. Python
		2. Gource
		3. Git
		
####2.2 A copy of your source code, and instructions on how people can compile / run your code
		1. Make sure Git and Gource are installed and avaliable from cmd
		2. Download/Clone this project into the directory with other Git projects 
		3. Run parse.py		
		
####2.3 A list of the data sources (repos, posts, etc) you are using for your experiment
		1. JQuery Mobile
		2. JQuery
		3. Bootstrap	
		4. Rails
		
####2.4 A list of the metrics you are collecting, justifying their use in answering your question
		1. Number of files added, removed, and modified. 
		2. Commit message string
	
##3 The results of your experiment


##4 An analysis of these results

####4.1 An answer to your original question based on these data sources and your methodology
  
####4.2 Threats to validity

####4.3 Future work

	
##5 Project management information
####5.1 Milestones and timelines
### Week 0

+ Finish the plan

### Week 1

+ Edit Gource to only show edits from specified user
+ Implement multi-function choice
+ Create algorithms/methods for additional graphs

### Week 2

+ Implement GIT api
+ Modify re-factor time stamp

### Week 3

+ Push all data to HTML page

## Changed/Added Features
1. **Git API** Use git api instead of local clones #5 
2. **Multi Function** Let User select which functions to run (Gource vs Chart) #6 
3. **HTML Output** Output info in an html page #7 
4. **Time Stamp** Modify "refactors" to be time between the users last commit #8 
5. **Specific Users** Display only the actions of users associated with the commit #9 
6. **Additional graphs** Additional graphs comparing different information #10 
7. **Automated Analysis** Write code to automatically analyze the Gource results #11 

####5.2 Roles of team members
