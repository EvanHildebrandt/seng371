Project Question: How does the groupings of file types vs groupings of functionality affect the ability for the project to evolve?

Methodology: Anaylze release and tag them based on, Security Update, Bug fixes, feature releases, preformance improvements, refactors. Use some statistics on these to understand the frequenct of these types of updates. Visually inspect the codebase using dependancy visualization tools (Gource) to gain details of the nature of these changes. 

Codebases/Systems: JQuery Mobile, JQuery, Bootstrap, Angular. 

Project Milestones: 
  1) Inspecting Release notes and tagging by category
  2) Summarizing the nature of the releases
  3) Setting up Gource with the codebases 
  4) Noting major changes with gource and compareing to the patch notes
